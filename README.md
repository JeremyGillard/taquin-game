## Description

Taquin is a solitaire game in the form of checkerboard created around 1807 in United States. Its mathematic theory was published by the American Journal of mathematics pure and applied in 1879. It is composed by 15 small squares numbered from 1 to 15 that can slide in a framework intended for 16. This game consist to put back the 15 squares starting from a random initial configuration.

The principle has been extended to all kinds of other games. Most of them are based on rectangular blocks but the goal is always to arrange the blocks in a deterministic position in a minimum of movements.

Rubik's Cube is today considered as a descendant of the Taquin. [Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taquin)
